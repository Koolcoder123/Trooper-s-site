      <h1>Trooper's site</h1>
 <p>This is just a personal site that I decided to code one day in plain html. Html is good and all, I am the only person that I know that actually knows how to code in it. I know this site is nothing that good to look at
 but I am not going to put a lot of time into some random ass website that I made one day.</p>

      <h3>Dec 1, 2023:Highschool thoughts</h3>
      <p>Right now I am in 7th grade. I don't know why I have so many thoughts about highschool. If anything I should be thinking of 8th grade but that is not that different from 7th grade. Same teachers same school. 
      The only thing that is really different is the work that we get and the time we go places.</p>
